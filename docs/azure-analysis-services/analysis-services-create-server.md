# Quickstart: Create a server - Portal

This quickstart describes how to create an Analysis Services server resource in your Azure subscription by using the portal.

## Prerequisites 

* **Azure subscription**: Visit [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) to create an account.
* **Microsoft Entra ID**: Your subscription must be associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant. And, you need to be signed in to Azure with an account in that Microsoft Entra ID. To learn more, see [Authentication and user permissions](analysis-services-manage-users.md).

## Sign in to the Azure portal 

[Sign in to the portal](https://portal.azure.com)


## Create a server

1. Click **+ Create a resource** > **Analytics** > **Analysis Services**.

2. In **Analysis Services**, fill in the required fields, and then press **Create**.
   
   * **Server name**: Type a unique name used to reference the server. The server name must begin with a lowercase character and contain between 3 to 128 lowercase characters and numbers. Whitespaces and special characters are not allowed.
   * **Subscription**: Select the subscription this server will be associated with.
   * **Resource group**: Create a new resource group or select one you already have. Resource groups are designed to help you manage a collection of Azure resources. To learn more, see [resource groups](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md).
   * **Location**: This Azure datacenter location hosts the server. Choose a location nearest your largest user base.
   * **Pricing tier**: Select a pricing tier. If you are testing and intend to install the sample model database, select the free **D1** tier. To learn more, see [Azure Analysis Services pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/analysis-services/). 
   * **Administrator**: By default, this will be the account you are logged in with. You can choose a different account from your Microsoft Entra ID.
   * **Backup Storage setting**: Optional. If you already have a [storage account](../storage/common/storage-introduction.md), you can specify it as the default for model database backup. You can also specify [backup and restore](analysis-services-backup.md) settings later.
   * **Storage key expiration**: Optional. Specify a storage key expiration period.

Creating the server usually takes under a minute. If you selected **Add to Portal**, navigate to your portal to see your new server. Or, navigate to **All services** > **Analysis Services** to see if your server is ready. Servers support tabular models at the 1200 and higher compatibility levels. Model compatibility level is specified in Visual Studio or SSMS.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, delete your server. In your server's **Overview**, click **Delete**.

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you learned how to create a server in your Azure subscription. Now that you have server, you can help secure it by configuring an (optional) server firewall. You can also add a basic sample data model to your server right from the portal. Having a sample model is helpful when learning about configuring model database roles and testing client connections. To learn more, continue to the tutorial for adding a sample model.
