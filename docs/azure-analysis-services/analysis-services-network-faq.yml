sections:
  - name: Backup and restore
    questions:
      - question: |
          How can I backup and restore using a storage account that is behind a firewall?   
        answer: |
          Azure Analysis Services does not use fixed IP addresses or Service Tags. The range of IP addresses your Analysis Services servers use can be anything in the range of IP addresses for the *Azure region*. Because your server IP addresses are variable and can change over time, your firewall rules need to allow for the entire range of Azure region IP addresses your server is in.

      - question: |
          My Azure storage account is in a different region from my Analysis Services server. How do I configure storage account firewall settings?   
        answer: |
          If the storage account is in a different region, configure storage account firewall settings to allow access from **Selected networks**. In Firewall **Address range**, specify the IP address range for the region the Analysis Services server is in. To get the IP ranges for Azure regions, see [Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags â€“ Public Cloud](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=56519). Configuring storage account firewall settings to allow access from All networks is supported, however choosing Selected networks and specifying an IP address range is preferred. 
          
      - question: |
          My Azure storage account is in the same region as my Analysis Services server. How can I configure storage account firewall settings?   
        answer: |
          Because your Analysis Services server and storage account are in the same region, communications between them use internal IP address ranges, therefore, configuring a firewall to use Selected networks and specifying an IP address range is not supported. If organization policies require a firewall, it must be configured to allow access from All networks.
          
          
  - name: Data source connections
    questions:
      - question: |
          I have a VNET for my data source system. How can I allow my Analysis Services servers to access the database from the VNET?   
        answer: |
          Azure Analysis Services is unable to join a VNET. The best solution here is to install and configure an On-premises Data Gateway on the VNET, and then configure your Analysis Services servers with the **AlwaysUseGateway** server property. To learn more, see [Use gateway for data sources on an Azure Virtual Network (VNet)](analysis-services-vnet-gateway.md).
          
      - question: |
          I have a source database behind a firewall. How can I configure the firewall to allow my Analysis Services server to access it?   
        answer: |
          Azure Analysis Services does not use fixed IP addresses or Service Tags. The range of IP addresses your Analysis Services servers use can be anything in the range of IP addresses for the *Azure region*. You  have to provide the *full range* of IP addresses for the Azure region of your server in the source database firewall rules. Another, and possibly more secure, alternative is to configure an On-premises Data Gateway. You can then configure your Analysis Services servers with the [AlwaysUseGateway server property](analysis-services-vnet-gateway.md#configure-alwaysusegateway-property), and then ensure the On-premises Data Gateway has an IP address allowed by the firewall rules of the data source.

  - name: Consumer email accounts
    questions:
      - question: |
          Can I invite consumer email accounts (such as outlook.com and gmail.com) to the tenant and give permissions to access Azure Analysis Services?
        answer: |
          Yes, Azure Analysis Services supports B2C accounts (consumer email accounts who are invited into the Server tenant). However there are limitations with such accounts, for example Single Sign-On from Power BI service live connect reports might not be supported for some providers of consumer email accounts.
          
  - name: Azure apps with IP address
    questions:
      - question: |
          I use an Azure-based application (for example, Azure Functions, Azure Data Factory) with an IP address that changes on the fly. How can I manage the Azure Analysis Services firewall rules to dynamically allow the IP address where my app is executing?   
        answer: |
          Azure Analysis Services does not support Private Links, VNETs, or Service Tags. There are some open-source solutions (for example, https://github.com/mathwro/Scripts/blob/master/Azure/AllowAzure-AnalysisServer.ps1) that detect the IP address of the client application, and automatically and temporarily update the firewall rules.
          
  - name: Client that is behind firewall can enable URL based rule
    questions:
      - question: |
          I use a client that has a firewall between the client and the Internet to reach Azure Analysis Services. What URL should I configure to allow the traffic to go through the firewall
        answer: |
          - api.powerbi.com
          - login.windows.net
          - *.asazure.windows.net
