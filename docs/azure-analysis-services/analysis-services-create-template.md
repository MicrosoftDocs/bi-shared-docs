# Quickstart: Create a server - ARM template

This quickstart describes how to create an Analysis Services server resource in your Azure subscription by using an Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template).

[!INCLUDE [About Azure Resource Manager](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/resource-manager-quickstart-introduction.md)]

If your environment meets the prerequisites and you're familiar with using ARM templates, select the **Deploy to Azure** button. The template will open in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**: Visit [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) to create an account.
* **Microsoft Entra ID**: Your subscription must be associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant. And, you need to be signed in to Azure with an account in that Microsoft Entra ID. To learn more, see [Authentication and user permissions](analysis-services-manage-users.md).

## Review the template

The template used in this quickstart is from [Azure templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/resources/templates/analysis-services-create/).

:::code language="json" source="~/quickstart-templates/quickstarts/microsoft.analysisservices/analysis-services-create/azuredeploy.json":::

A single [Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers](/azure/templates/microsoft.analysisservices/servers) resource with a firewall rule is defined in the template.

## Deploy the template

1. Select the following Deploy to Azure link to sign in to Azure and open a template. The template is used to create an Analysis Services server resource and specify required and optional properties.

   :::image type="content" source="~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/media/template-deployments/deploy-to-azure-button.svg" alt-text="Button to deploy the Resource Manager template to Azure." border="false" link="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2Fquickstarts%2Fmicrosoft.analysisservices%2Fanalysis-services-create%2Fazuredeploy.json":::

2. Select or enter the following values.

    Unless specified otherwise, use default values.

    * **Subscription**: Select an Azure subscription.
    * **Resource group**: Click **Create new**, and then enter a unique name for the new resource group.
    * **Location**: Select a default location for resources created in the resource group.
    * **Server Name**: Enter a name for the server resource. 
    * **Location**: Ignore for Analysis Services. Location is specified in Server Location.
    * **Server location**: Enter the location of the Analysis Services server. This is often the same region as the default Location specified for the Resource Group, but not required. For example **North Central US**. For supported regions, see [Analysis Services availability by region](analysis-services-overview.md#availability-by-region).
    * **Sku Name**: Enter the sku name for the Analysis Services server to create. Choose from: B1, B2, D1, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S8v2, S9v2. Sku availability depends on region. S0 or D1 is recommended for evaluation and testing.
    * **Capacity**: Enter the total number of query replica scale-out instances. Scale-out of more than one instance is supported in select regions only.
    * **Firewall Settings**: Enter inbound firewall rules to define for the server. If not specified, firewall is disabled.
    * **Backup Blob Container Uri**: Enter the SAS URI to a private Azure Blob Storage container with read, write and list permissions. Required only if you intend to use [Backup/restore](analysis-services-backup.md).
    * **I agree to the terms and conditions state above**: Select.

3. Select **Purchase**. After the server has been deployed successfully, you get a notification:

   ![ARM template, deploy portal notification](./media/analysis-services-create-template/notification.png)

## Validate the deployment

Use the Azure portal or Azure PowerShell to verify the resource group and server resource was created.

### PowerShell

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
(Get-AzResource -ResourceType "Microsoft.AnalysisServices/servers" -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName).Name
 Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```

---

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or Azure PowerShell to delete the resource group and the server resource.

# [CLI](#tab/CLI)

```azurecli-interactive
echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
read resourceGroupName &&
az group delete --name $resourceGroupName &&
echo "Press [ENTER] to continue ..."
```

# [PowerShell](#tab/PowerShell)

```azurepowershell-interactive
$resourceGroupName = Read-Host -Prompt "Enter the Resource Group name"
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroupName
Write-Host "Press [ENTER] to continue..."
```

---

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you used an ARM template to create a new resource group and an Azure Analysis Services server resource. After you've created a server resource by using the template, consider the following:
