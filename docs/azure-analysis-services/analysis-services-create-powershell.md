# Quickstart: Create a server - PowerShell

This quickstart describes using PowerShell from the command line to create an Azure Analysis Services server in your Azure subscription.

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [updated-for-az](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/updated-for-az.md)]

- **Azure subscription**: Visit [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0044p/) to create an account.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: Your subscription must be associated with a Microsoft Entra tenant and you must have an account in that directory. To learn more, see [Authentication and user permissions](analysis-services-manage-users.md).
- **Azure PowerShell**. To find the installed version, run `Get-Module -ListAvailable Az`. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-azure-powershell).

## Import Az.AnalysisServices module

To create a server in your subscription, you use the [Az.AnalysisServices](/powershell/module/az.analysisservices) module. Load the Az.AnalysisServices module into your PowerShell session.

```powershell
Import-Module Az.AnalysisServices
```

## Sign in to Azure

Sign in to your Azure subscription by using the [Connect-AzAccount](/powershell/module/az.accounts/connect-azaccount) command. Follow the on-screen directions.

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

## Create a resource group

An [Azure resource group](../azure-resource-manager/management/overview.md) is a logical container where Azure resources are deployed and managed as a group. When you create your server, you must specify a resource group in your subscription. If you do not already have a resource group, you can create a new one by using the [New-AzResourceGroup](/powershell/module/az.resources/new-azresourcegroup) command. The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the West US region.

```powershell
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "WestUS"
```

## Create a server

Create a new server by using the [New-AzAnalysisServicesServer](/powershell/module/az.analysisservices/new-azanalysisservicesserver) command. The following example creates a server named myServer in myResourceGroup, in the WestUS region, at the D1 (free) tier, and specifies philipc@adventureworks.com as a server administrator.

```powershell
New-AzAnalysisServicesServer -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myserver" -Location WestUS -Sku D1 -Administrator "philipc@adventure-works.com"
```

## Clean up resources

You can remove the server from your subscription by using the [Remove-AzAnalysisServicesServer](/powershell/module/az.analysisservices/new-azanalysisservicesserver) command. If you continue with other quickstarts and tutorials in this collection, do not remove your server. The following example removes the server created in the previous step.


```powershell
Remove-AzAnalysisServicesServer -Name "myserver" -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you learned how to create a server in your Azure subscription by using PowerShell. Now that you have server, you can help secure it by configuring an (optional) server firewall. You can also add a basic sample data model to your server right from the portal. Having a sample model is helpful when learning about configuring model database roles and testing client connections. To learn more, continue to the tutorial for adding a sample model.
