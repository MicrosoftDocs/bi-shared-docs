# Connect with Excel

 This article describes connecting to an Azure Analysis Services resource by using the Excel desktop app. Connecting to an Azure Analysis Services resource is not supported in Excel for the web or Excel for Mac.

## Before you begin

The account you sign in with must belong to a model database role with at least read permissions. To learn more, see [Authentication and user permissions](analysis-services-manage-users.md). 

## Connect in Excel

Connecting to a server in Excel is supported by using Get Data in Excel 2016 and later. Connecting by using the Import Table Wizard in Power Pivot is not supported. 

1. In Excel, on the **Data** ribbon, click **Get Data** > **From Database** > **From Analysis Services**.

2. In the Data Connection Wizard, in **Server name**, enter the server name including protocol and URI. For example, asazure://westcentralus.asazure.windows.net/advworks. Then, in **Logon credentials**, select **Use the following User Name and Password**, and then type the organizational user name, for example nancy@adventureworks.com, and password.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you sign in with a Microsoft Account, Live ID, Yahoo, Gmail, etc., or you are required to sign in with multi-factor authentication, leave the password field blank. You are prompted for a password after clicking Next.
