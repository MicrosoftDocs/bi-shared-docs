# Analysis Services Scripting Language XML Data Types (ASSL)

  This reference section contains syntax and usage information for each element that acts as a type in the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema.  
  
 Although the ASSL schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, the elements described in this section correspond to types, such as **Binding** and **Permission**, which are used to define the child elements and properties of other objects.  
  
 Type elements, like objects elements, are never leaf-level elements in the ASSL schema, but have child elements and elements that correspond to object properties.  
  
 However a type element never appears as an element in a script that defines or describes Analysis Services objects. Instead it appears as the type of other object elements, normally designated with the **type** attribute from the XML Schema Instance schema using **xsi:type** or **xs:type**. For example, `<Assembly xsi:type="ClrAssembly"\>...</Assembly\>`.  
  
 In some cases, a type derives from another type. For example, the **CubeBinding** type derives from the parent **Binding** type.
