# Analysis Services Scripting Language XML Elements (ASSL)

  Although the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL) schema contains only XML elements, from a developer's point of view, these elements correspond to the following concepts:  
  
-   Objects, such as **Database**, **Cube**, and **Dimension** objects, in the hierarchy of objects contained by an instance of Analysis Services.  
  
-   Collections of objects, such as the **Dimensions** and **Cubes** collections.  
  
-   Properties, such as **Name** and **Description**, that describe objects.  
  
-   Data types, such as **Binding** and **Permission**, that are used to define the child elements and properties of other objects.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  This section does not cover data type elements. For more information, see, [Analysis Services Scripting Language XML Data Types &#40;ASSL&#41;](data-type/analysis-services-scripting-language-xml-data-types-assl.md).
