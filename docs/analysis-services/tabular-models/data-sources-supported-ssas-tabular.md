# Data sources supported in SQL Server Analysis Services tabular 1200 models

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all](../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all.md)]
  
This article describes the types of data sources that can be used with **SQL Server Analysis Services** (SSAS) tabular models at the 1200 and lower compatibility level. For **Azure Analysis Services**, see [Data sources supported in Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-datasource).
  
## Supported data sources for in-memory tabular models

When you install [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)], setup does not install the providers that are listed for each data source. Some providers might be installed with other applications on your computer. In other cases, you may need to download and install the provider.

<a name="dnu">[1]</a> Using ACE 14 OLE DB provider to connect to file data types is not recommended. If you must retain your tabular 1200 and lower compatibility level models, export your data to a csv file type, import to SQL database, and then connect to and import from the database. However, it's recommended you upgrade to tabular 1400 compatibility level (SQL Server 2017 and later) and use **Get Data** in SSDT to select and import your file data source. Get Data uses structured data source connections provided by the Power Query data engine, which are more stable than ACE 14 OLE DB provider connections.  

<a name="dnu2">[2]</a> If deploying a tabular 1200 model to Azure Analysis Services or SQL Server Analysis Services, **it's recommended** you use the updated Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL). For SQL Server Analysis Services, it may be necessary to download and install the MSOLEDBSQL driver on the server. To learn more, see [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](/sql/connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server).

<a name="dnu3">[3]</a> SQL Server Native Client (SQLNCLI) and previous generation OLE DB Provider for SQL Server (SQLOLEDB) are deprecated. It's recommended you use the updated [Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server](/sql/connect/oledb/oledb-driver-for-sql-server).


## Supported data sources for DirectQuery models

 DirectQuery is an alternative to in-memory storage mode, routing queries to and returning results directly from backend data systems rather than storing all data inside the model (and in RAM once the model is loaded). Because Analysis Services has to formulate queries in the native database query syntax, a smaller subset of data sources is supported for this mode.

## Tips for choosing data sources  
  
Importing tables from relational databases saves you steps because *foreign key* relationships are used during import to create relationships between tables in the model designer.  
  
Importing multiple tables, and then deleting the ones you don't need, can also save you steps. If you import tables one at a time, you might still need to create relationships between the tables manually.  
  
Columns that contain similar data in different data sources are the basis of creating relationships within the model designer. When using heterogeneous data sources, choose tables that have columns that can be mapped to tables in other data sources that contain identical or similar data.  
  
OLE DB providers can sometimes offer faster performance for large-scale data. When choosing between different providers for the same data source, you should try the OLE DB provider first.
