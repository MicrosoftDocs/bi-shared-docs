# Process database, table, or partition (Analysis Services)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip.md)]

  The tasks in this article describe how to process a tabular model database, table, or partitions manually by using the **Process \<object>** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)].  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_process_db"></a> To process a database  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], right-click on the database you want to process, and then click **Process Database**.  
  
2.  In the **Process Database** dialog box, in the **Mode** listbox, select one of the following process modes:  
  
    |Mode|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**Process Default**|Detects the process state of database objects, and performs processing necessary to deliver unprocessed or partially processed objects to a fully processed state. Data for empty tables and partitions is loaded; hierarchies, calculated columns, and relationships are built or rebuilt (recalculated).|  
    |**Process Full**|Processes a database and all the objects that it contains. When Process Full is run for an object that has already been processed, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] drops all data in the object, and then processes the object. This kind of processing is required when a structural change has been made to an object. This option requires the most resources.|  
    |**Process Clear**|Removes all data from database objects.|  
    |**Process Recalc**|Updates and recalculates hierarchies, relationships, and calculated columns.|  
  
3.  In the **Process** checkbox column, select the partitions you want to process with the selected mode, and then click **Ok**.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_process_table"></a> To process a table  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], in the tabular model database which contains the table you want to process, expand the **Tables** node, then right-click on the table you want to process, and then click **Process Table**.  
  
2.  In the **Process Table** dialog box, in the **Mode** listbox, select one of the following process modes:  
  
    |Mode|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**Process Default**|Detects the process state of a table object, and performs processing necessary to deliver unprocessed or partially processed objects to a fully processed state. Data for empty tables and partitions is loaded; hierarchies, calculated columns, and relationships are built or rebuilt (recalculated).|  
    |**Process Full**|Processes a table object and all the objects that it contains. When Process Full is run for an object that has already been processed, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] drops all data in the object, and then processes the object. This kind of processing is required when a structural change has been made to an object. This option requires the most resources.|  
    |**Process Data**|Load data into a table without rebuilding hierarchies or relationships or recalculating calculated columns and measures.|  
    |**Process Clear**|Removes all data from a table and any table partitions.|  
    |**Process Defrag**|Defragments the auxiliary table indexes.|  
  
3.  In the table checkbox column, verify the table and optionally select any additional tables you want to process, and then click **Ok**.  
  
##  <a name="bkmk_process_partition"></a> To process one or more partitions  
  
1.  In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], right-click on the table that has the partitions you want to process, and then click **Partitions**.  
  
2.  In the **Partitions** dialog box, in **Partitions**, click the Process button.  
  
3.  In the **Process Partition** dialog box, in the **Mode** listbox, select one of the following process modes:  
  
    |Mode|Description|  
    |----------|-----------------|  
    |**Process Default**|Detects the process state of a partition object, and performs processing necessary to deliver unprocessed or partially processed partition objects to a fully processed state. Data for empty tables and partitions is loaded; hierarchies, calculated columns, and relationships are built or rebuilt (recalculated).|  
    |**Process Full**|Processes a partition object and all the objects that it contains. When Process Full is run for an object that has already been processed, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] drops all data in the object, and then processes the object. This kind of processing is required when a structural change has been made to an object.|  
    |**Process Data**|Load data into a partition or a table without rebuilding hierarchies or relationships or recalculating calculated columns and measures.|  
    |**Process Clear**|Removes all data from a partition.|  
    |**Process Add**|Incrementally update partition with new data.|  
  
4.  In the **Process** checkbox column, select the partitions you want to process with the selected mode, and then click **Ok**.
