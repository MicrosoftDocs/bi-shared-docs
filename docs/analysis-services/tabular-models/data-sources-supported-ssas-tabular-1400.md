# Data sources supported in SQL Server Analysis Services tabular 1400 and higher models

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all](../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all.md)]

This article describes the types of data sources that can be used with **SQL Server Analysis Services** (SSAS) tabular models at the 1400 and higher compatibility level. For **Azure Analysis Services**, see [Data sources supported in Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-datasource).

## Cloud data sources

|Datasource  |In-memory  |DirectQuery  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Azure SQL Database     |   Yes      |    Yes      |
|Azure Synapse Analytics (SQL Data Warehouse)     |   Yes      |   Yes       |
|Azure Blob Storage     |   Yes       |    No      |
|Azure Table Storage    |   Yes       |    No      |
|Azure Cosmos DB     |  Yes        |  No        |
|Azure Data Lake Store (Gen1)<sup>[1](#gen2)</sup>      |   Yes       |    No      |

<a name="gen2">1</a> - ADLS Gen2 is currently not supported.  
<a name="databricks">2</a> - Azure Databricks using the Spark connector is currently not supported.  

**Provider**  
In-memory and DirectQuery models connecting to Azure data sources use .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server.

## On-premises data sources

### Supported by in-memory and DirectQuery models

|Datasource | In-memory provider | DirectQuery provider |
|  --- | --- | --- |
| SQL Server |Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL), .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server | .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server |
| SQL Server Data Warehouse |Microsoft OLE DB Driver for SQL Server (MSOLEDBSQL), .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server | .NET Framework Data Provider for SQL Server |
| Oracle | Oracle Data Provider for .NET |Oracle Data Provider for .NET |
| Teradata |OLE DB Provider for Teradata, Teradata Data Provider for .NET |Teradata Data Provider for .NET |
| | | |

> [!NOTE]
> For in-memory models, OLE DB providers can provide better performance for large-scale data. When choosing between different providers for the same data source, try the OLE DB provider first.
