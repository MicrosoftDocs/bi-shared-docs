# Attribute Properties - Define a New Attribute Automatically
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  You can create a new attribute in a dimension by using drag-and-drop editing in the Dimension Designer.  
  
### To create a new attribute automatically  
  
1.  In Dimension Designer, open the dimension in which you want to create the attribute.  
  
2.  On the **Dimension Structure** tab, in the **Data Source View** pane, in the table to which you want to bind the attribute, select the column, and then drag the column to the **Attributes** pane.  
  
     [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] creates the new attribute that has the same name as the column to which it is bound. If there are multiple attributes that use the same column, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] appends a number to the attribute name.
