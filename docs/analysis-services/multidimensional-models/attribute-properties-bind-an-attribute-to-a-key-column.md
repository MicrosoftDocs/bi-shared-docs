# Attribute Properties - Bind an Attribute to a Key Column
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  This procedure describes how to change the setting for the **Name** property of an attribute in a dimension.  
  
### To bind an attribute to a key column  
  
1.  In Dimension Designer, open the dimension that contains the attribute you want to rename.  
  
2.  In the **Attributes** pane of the Dimension Builder view, change the display format to either **Tree** or **List**. For more information about how to change the format of the Attributes pane, see [View Attributes in a Tree, List or Grid in Dimension Designer](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/view-attributes-in-dimension-designer.md).  
  
3.  Right-click the attribute you want to configure, and then click **Rename**.  
  
4.  Type the new name.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can also set the **Name** property of a selected attribute in the **Properties** window of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)].
