# Maximum capacity specifications (Analysis Services)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  The following tables specify the maximum sizes and numbers of various objects defined in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] components under different server deployment modes.  
  
 This topic contains the following sections:

 MOLAP storage mode, which stores both data and metadata, has additional physical limits on file sizes. String store files are a maximum size of 4 GB by default. If you require larger files for string stores, you can specify a different string storage architecture. For more information, see [Configure String Storage for Dimensions and Partitions](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/configure-string-storage-for-dimensions-and-partitions.md).
