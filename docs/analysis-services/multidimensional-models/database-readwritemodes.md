# Database ReadWriteModes
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  There are often situations when an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database administrator (dba) wants to change a read/write database to a read-only database, or vice versa. These situations are often driven by business needs, such as sharing the same database folder among several servers for scaling out a solution and improving performance. For these situations, the **ReadWriteMode** database property enables the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] dba to easily change the database operating mode.  
  
## ReadWriteMode database property  
 The **ReadWriteMode** database property specifies whether the database is in read/write mode or in read-only mode. These are the only two possible values of the property. When the database is in read-only mode, no changes or updates can be applied to the database. However, when the database is in read/write mode, changes and updates can occur. The **ReadWriteMode** database property is defined as a read-only property; it can only be set through an **Attach** command.  
  
 When a database is in read-only mode, certain restrictions are in place that affect the ordinary set of allowed operations to the database. See the following table for the restricted operations.  
  
|ReadOnly mode|Restricted operations|  
|-------------------|---------------------------|  
|XML/A commands<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: An error is raised when you execute any one of these commands.|**Create**<br /><br /> **Alter**<br /><br /> **Delete**<br /><br /> **Process**<br /><br /> **MergePartitions**<br /><br /> **DesignAggregations**<br /><br /> **CommitTransaction**<br /><br /> **Restore**<br /><br /> **Synchronize**<br /><br /> **Insert**<br /><br /> **Update**<br /><br /> **Drop**<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: Cell writeback is allowed in databases set to read-only; however, the changes cannot be committed.|  
|MDX statements<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: An error is raised when you execute any one of these statements.|**COMMIT TRAN**<br /><br /> **CREATE SESSION CUBE**<br /><br /> **ALTER CUBE**<br /><br /> **ALTER DIMENSION**<br /><br /> **CREATE DIMENSION MEMBER**<br /><br /> **DROP DIMENSION MEMBER**<br /><br /> **ALTER DIMENSION**<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: Excel users cannot use the grouping feature in Pivot tables, because that feature is internally implemented by using **CREATE SESSION CUBE** commands.|  
|DMX statements<br /><br /> <br /><br /> Note: An error is raised when you execute any one of these statements.|**CREATE [SESSION] MINING STRUCTURE**<br /><br /> **ALTER MINING STRUCTURE**<br /><br /> **DROP MINING STRUCTURE**<br /><br /> **CREATE [SESSION] MINING MODEL**<br /><br /> **DROP MINING MODEL**<br /><br /> **IMPORT**<br /><br /> **SELECT INTO**<br /><br /> **INSERT**<br /><br /> **UPDATE**<br /><br /> **DELETE**|  
|Background operations|Any background operations that would modify the database are disabled. This includes lazy processing and proactive caching.|  
  
## ReadWriteMode Usage  
 The **ReadWriteMode** database property is to be used as part of an **Attach** database command. The **Attach** command allows the database property to be set to either **ReadWrite** or **ReadOnly**. The **ReadWriteMode** database property value cannot be updated directly because the property is defined as read-only. Databases are created with the **ReadWriteMode** property set to **ReadWrite**. A database cannot be created in read-only mode.  
  
 To switch the **ReadWriteMode** database property between **ReadWrite** and **ReadOnly**, you must issue a sequence of **Detach/Attach** commands.  
  
 All database operations, with the exception of **Attach**, keep the **ReadWriteMode** database property in its current state. For example, operations like **Alter**, **Backup**, **Restore**, and **Synchronize** preserve the **ReadWriteMode** value.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Local cubes can be created from a read-only database.
