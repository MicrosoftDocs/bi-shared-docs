# MDX Data Manipulation - Manipulating Data
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) can be used to manipulate the data in a variety of ways. The following topics cover some of the more advanced concepts of data manipulation in the MDX language  
  
## In This Section  
  
|Topic|Description|  
|-----------|-----------------|  
|[Using DRILLTHROUGH to Retrieve Source Data &#40;MDX&#41;](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-data-manipulation-retrieve-source-data-using-drillthrough.md)|Discusses the use of the MDX [DRILLTHROUGH](/sql/mdx/mdx-data-manipulation-drillthrough) statement to retrieve the rowsets of source data applicable to a cell in a multidimensional data source|  
|[Working with the RollupChildren Function &#40;MDX&#41;](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-data-manipulation-rollupchildren-function.md)|Discusses the impact of the MDX [RollupChildren](/sql/mdx/rollupchildren-mdx)function on the analysis of multidimensional data.|  
|[Understanding Pass Order and Solve Order &#40;MDX&#41;](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/mdx/mdx-data-manipulation-understanding-pass-order-and-solve-order.md)|Details the concepts of solve order, and how this feature affects MDX expressions, statements, and scripts.|
