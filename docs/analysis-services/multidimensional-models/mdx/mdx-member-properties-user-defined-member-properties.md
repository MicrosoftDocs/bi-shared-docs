# MDX Member Properties - User-Defined Member Properties
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  User-defined member properties can be added to a specific named level in a dimension as attribute relationships. User-defined member properties cannot be added to the **(All)** level of a hierarchy, or to the hierarchy itself.  
  
## Creating User-Defined Member Properties  
 User-defined member properties can be added to server-based dimensions or cubes either through the user interface or programmatically:  
  
-   To add user-defined member properties through the user interface, you use Dimension Designer in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]. For more information, see [Define Attribute Relationships](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/attribute-relationships-define.md).  
  
-   To add user-defined member properties programmatically, your application can use either Analysis Manager Objects (AMO) or a combination of XML for Analysis (XMLA) and Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL). For more information, see [Attribute Relationships](../../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-olap-logical-dimension-objects/attribute-relationships.md).  
  
## Retrieving User-Defined Member Properties  
 You can retrieve user-defined member properties using either the **PROPERTIES** keyword or the [Properties](/sql/mdx/properties-mdx) function.  
  
### Using the PROPERTIES Keyword to Retrieve User-Defined Member Properties  
 The syntax that retrieves user-defined member properties is similar to that used to retrieve intrinsic level member properties, as shown in the following syntax:  
  
 `DIMENSION PROPERTIES [Dimension.]Level.<Custom_Member_Property>`  
  
 The **PROPERTIES** keyword appears after the set expression of the axis specification. For example, the following MDX query the **PROPERTIES** keyword retrieves the `List Price` and `Dealer Price` user-defined member properties and appears after the set expression that identifies the products sold in January:  
  
```  
SELECT   
   CROSSJOIN([Ship Date].[Calendar].[Calendar Year].Members,   
             [Measures].[Sales Amount]) ON COLUMNS,  
   NON EMPTY Product.Product.MEMBERS  
   DIMENSION PROPERTIES   
              Product.Product.[List Price],  
              Product.Product.[Dealer Price]  ON ROWS  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
WHERE ([Date].[Month of Year].[January])   
```  
  
### Using the Properties Function to Retrieve User-Defined Member Properties  
 Alternatively, you can access custom member properties with the **Properties** function. For example, the following MDX query uses the **WITH** keyword to create a calculated member consisting of the `List Price` member property:  
  
```  
WITH   
   MEMBER [Measures].[Product List Price] AS  
   [Product].[Product].CurrentMember.Properties("List Price")  
SELECT   
   [Measures].[Product List Price] on COLUMNS,  
   [Product].[Product].MEMBERS  ON Rows  
FROM [Adventure Works]  
```
