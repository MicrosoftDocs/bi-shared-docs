# MDX Cell Properties - FORMATTED_VALUE Property
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip](../../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip.md)]

  The FORMATTED_VALUE property is built on the interactions of the VALUE, FORMAT_STRING and LANGUAGE properties of the cell. This topic explains how these properties interact to build the FORMATTED_VALUE property.  
  
## VALUE, FORMAT_STRING, LANGUAGE properties  
 The following table explains what these properties are, to help prepare us to use them in combination.  
  
 VALUE  
 The unformatted value of the cell.  
  
 FORMAT_STRING  
 The formatting template to be applied to the value of the cell to generate FORMATTED_VALUE property  
  
 LANGUAGE  
 The locale specification to be applied alongside FORMAT_STRING to generate a localized version of FORMATTED_VALUE  
  
## FORMATTED_VALUE constructed  
 The FORMATTED_VALUE property is constructed by using the value from the VALUE property and applying the format template specified in the FORMAT_STRING property to that value. In addition, whenever the formatting value is a **named formatting literal** the LANGUAGE property specification modifies the output of FORMAT_STRING to follow the language usage for the named formatting. Named formatting literals are all defined in a way that can be localized. For example, `"General Date"` is a specification that can be localized, as opposed to the following template `"YYYY-MM-DD hh:nn:ss",` which states that the date is to be presented as defined by the template regardless of the language specification.  
  
 If there is a conflict between the FORMAT_STRING template and the LANGUAGE specification, the FORMAT_STRING template overrides the LANGUAGE specification. For example, if FORMAT_STRING="$ #0" and LANGUAGE=1034 (Spain), and VALUE=123.456 then FORMATTED_VALUE="$ 123" instead of FORMATTED_VALUE="&euro; 123", the expected format is in Euros, because the value of the format template overrides the language specified.  
  
### Examples  
 The following examples show the output obtained when LANGUAGE is used in conjunction with FORMAT_STRING.  
  
 The first example explains formatting numerical values; the second example explains formatting date and time values.  
  
 For each example the Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) code is given.

|Member|FORMATTED_VALUE|Explanation|  
|------------|----------------------|-----------------|  
|A|$5,040.00|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Currency` and LANGUAGE is `1033`, inherited from system locale value|  
|B|&euro;5.040,00|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Currency` (inherited from A) and LANGUAGE is explicitly set to `1034` (Spain) hence the Euro sign, the different decimal separator and the different thousand separator.|  
|C|$5.040,00|FORMAT_STRING is set to `$#,##0.00` an override to Currency, from A, and LANGUAGE is explicitly set to `1034` (Spain). Because the FORMAT_STRING property explicitly set the currency symbol to $, the FORMATTED_VALUE is presented with the $ sign. However, because `.` (dot) and `,` (comma) are placeholders for decimal separator and thousand separator respectively, the language specification affects them generating an output that is localized for decimal and thousand separators.|  
|D|5.04E+03|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Scientific` and LANGUAGE is set to `1033`, inherited from system locale value, hence `.` (dot) is the decimal separator.|  
|E|5,04E+03|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Scientific` and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034,` hence `,` (comma) is the decimal separator.|  
|F|50.40%|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Percent` and LANGUAGE is set to `1033`, inherited from system locale value, hence `.` (dot) is the decimal separator.<br /><br /> Note that VALUE was changed from 5040 to 0.5040|  
|G|50,40%|FORMAT_STRING is set to `Percent`, inherited from F, and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034` hence `,` (comma) is the decimal separator.<br /><br /> Note that VALUE was inherited from F value.|  
|H|No|FORMAT_STRING is set to `YES/NO`, VALUE is set to 0 and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034`; because there is no difference between English NO and Spanish NO the user sees no difference in the FORMATTED_VALUE.|  
|I|SI|FORMAT_STRING is set to `YES/NO`, VALUE is set to 59 and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034`; as defined for YES/NO formatting, any value different from zero (0) is a YES and because language is set to Spanish then the FORMATTED_VALUE is SI.|  
|J|Desactivado|FORMAT_STRING is set to `ON/OFF`, VALUE is set to 0 and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034`; as defined for ON/OFF formatting, any value equal to zero (0) is an OFF and because language is set to Spanish then the FORMATTED_VALUE is Desactivado.|  
|K|Activado|FORMAT_STRING is set to `ON/OFF`, VALUE is set to -312 and LANGUAGE is set explicitly to `1034`; as defined for ON/OFF formatting, any value different from zero (0) is an ON and because language is set to Spanish then the FORMATTED_VALUE is Activado.|
