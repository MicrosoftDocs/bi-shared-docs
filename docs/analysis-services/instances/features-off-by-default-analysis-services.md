# Features off by default (Analysis Services)
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  An instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] is designed to be secure by default. Therefore, features that might compromise security are disabled by default. The following features are installed in a disabled state and must specifically be enabled if you want to use them.  
  
## Feature List  
 To enable the following features, connect to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. Right-click the instance name and choose **Facets**. Alternatively, you can enable these features through server properties, as described in the next section.

 Additional features that are off by default can be enabled through server properties. Connect to [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] using [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. Right-click the instance name and choose **Properties**. Click **General**, and then click **Show Advanced** to display a larger property list.
