# Upgrade encryption

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]

SQL Server 2022 Analysis Services CU1 and later includes enhanced encryption for certain write operations to the model database schema. To ensure your model databases use the latest encryption, those databases must be upgraded. If encryption isn't upgraded, certain database schema write operations, such as adding a new data source or altering connection strings are blocked and an error is returned.

> [!CAUTION]
> New or upgraded Analysis Services databases with enhanced encryption cannot be loaded if SQL Server CU1 is uninstalled.

## Tabular mode

For tabular model databases at the 1600 and higher compatibility level, the following error can be returned during certain schema write operations:

"**New Tabular database '%{DatabaseName/}' is not using latest encryption schema. Please run RemoveDiscontinuedFeatured command with EnsureProperEncryption option (or restore DB from backup file with the same option) to upgrade to the latest encryption.**"

To upgrade encryption, either backup the database and then restore with the **EnsureProperEncryption** option enabled by running the following XMLA command in SQL Server Management Studio:

```xml
<Batch xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2003/engine" Transaction="false" xmlns:ddl100_100="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2008/engine/100/100" xmlns:ddl100="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2008/engine/100">
<Restore xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2003/engine" xmlns:ddl922="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2022/engine/922">
<File>your_backup_file_pathname</File>
<AllowOverwrite>true</AllowOverwrite>
<ddl922:EnsureProperEncryption>true</ddl922:EnsureProperEncryption>
</Restore>
</Batch>
```

or if the database is already loaded, run the following XMLA command in SQL Server Management Studio:

```xml
<RemoveDiscontinuedFeatures xmlns='http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2003/engine' xmlns:ddl922='http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2022/engine/922'>
  <DatabaseID>DatabaseName</DatabaseID>
  <ddl922:EnsureProperEncryption>true</ddl922:EnsureProperEncryption>
</RemoveDiscontinuedFeatures>

```

## Multidimensional mode

For multidimensional model databases at all compatibility levels, the following error can be returned during certain schema write operations:

"**Multi-dimensional database '%{DatabaseName/}' is not using latest encryption schema. Please create a backup file and restore DB from backup file with the option EnsureProperEncryption to upgrade to the latest encryption.**"

To upgrade encryption, backup the database and then restore with the **EnsureProperEncryption** option enabled.

## Known issues

**Problem:** Changing SQL Server 2022 Analysis Services service account can cause the service to fail to start.

The following message in the Log\msmdsrv.log file indicates the service is unable to start because the service account has been changed:

"**Server Gen2 cryptokey is not present, but server assembly object System is set to use server gen2 cryptokey. Terminating server. (Source: \\?\C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSAS16.MSSQLSERVER\OLAP\Log\msmdsrv.log, Type: 1, Category: 289, Event ID: 0x4121005C**"

**Solution:** In the msmdsrv.ini file, in **ConfigurationSettings** > **DataDir**, determine the location of the **Data** folder. Then in the **Data** folder, delete the files with the name containing **.asm.xml**, and all folders with an **.asm** extension.

After deleting the files, restart the Analysis Services service. The .asm files are automatically created again.

The following encrypted properties must then be configured by using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):

- Log\QueryLog\QueryLogConnectionString.
- Each data source ImpersonationAccount password or authentication password.
