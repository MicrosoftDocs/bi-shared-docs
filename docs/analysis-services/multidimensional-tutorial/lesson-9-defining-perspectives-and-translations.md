# Lesson 9: Defining Perspectives and Translations
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]

In this lesson, you learn to define perspectives and translations. You can define perspectives to reduce the apparent complexity of a cube, and define translations that let users view the cube metadata in the language of their choice.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Completed projects for all of the lessons in this tutorial are available online. You can jump ahead to any lesson by using the completed project from the previous lesson as a starting point. See [Analysis Services samples](../analysis-services-samples.md) to download the sample projects that go with this tutorial.  
  
This lesson contains the following tasks:  
  
[Defining and Browsing Perspectives](lesson-9-1-defining-and-browsing-perspectives.md)  
In this task, you define and browse perspectives to simplify the view of the cube for specific users or uses.  
  
[Defining and Browsing Translations](lesson-9-2-defining-and-browsing-translations.md)  
In this task, you define and browse translations of specific metadata to certain languages.
