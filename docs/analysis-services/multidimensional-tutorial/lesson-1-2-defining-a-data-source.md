# Lesson 1-2 - Defining a Data Source
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]

After you create an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, you generally start working with the project by defining one or more data sources that the project will use. When you define a data source, you are defining the connection string information that will be used to connect to the data source. For more information, see [Create a Data Source &#40;SSAS Multidimensional&#41;](../multidimensional-models/create-a-data-source-ssas-multidimensional.md).  
  
In the following task, you define the AdventureWorksDW2019 sample database as the data source for the project. While this database is located on your local computer for the purposes of this tutorial, source databases are frequently hosted on one or more remote computers.  
  
### To define a new data source  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer (on the right of the Microsoft Visual Studio window), right-click **Data Sources**, and then click **New Data Source**.  
  
2.  On the **Welcome to the Data Source Wizard** page of the **Data Source Wizard**, click **Next** to open the **Select how to define the connection** page.  
  
3.  On the **Select how to define the connection** page, you can define a data source based on a new connection, based on an existing connection, or based on a previously defined data source object. In this tutorial, you define a data source based on a new connection. Verify that **Create a data source based on an existing or new connection** is selected, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **Connection Manager** dialog box, you define connection properties for the data source. In the **Provider** list box, verify that **Native OLE DB\SQL Server Native Client 11.0** is selected.  
  
    [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] also supports other providers, which are displayed in the **Provider** list.  
  
5.  In the **Server name** text box, type **localhost**.  
  
    To connect to a named instance on your local computer, type **localhost\\\<instance name\>**. To connect to the specific computer instead of the local computer, type the computer name or IP address.  
  
6.  Verify that **Use Windows Authentication** is selected. In the **Select or enter a database name** list, select **AdventureWorksDW2019**.  
  
7.  Click **Test Connection** to test the connection to the database.  
  
8.  Click **OK**, and then click **Next**.  
  
9. On the **Impersonation Information** page of the wizard, you define the security credentials for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] to use to connect to the data source. Impersonation affects the Windows account used to connect to the data source when Windows Authentication is selected. [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] does not support impersonation for processing OLAP objects. Select **Use the service account**, and then click **Next**.  
  
10. On the **Completing the Wizard** page, accept the default name, **Adventure Works DW 2019**, and then click **Finish** to create the new data source.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> To modify the properties of the data source after it has been created, double-click the data source in the **Data Sources** folder to display the data source properties in **Data Source Designer**.
