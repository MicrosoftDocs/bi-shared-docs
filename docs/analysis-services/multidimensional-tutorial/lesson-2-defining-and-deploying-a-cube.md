# Lesson 2: Defining and Deploying a Cube
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]

After you define a data source view in your [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, you are ready to define an initial [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] cube.  
  
You can define a cube and its dimensions in a single pass using the Cube Wizard. Alternatively, you can define one or more dimensions and then use the Cube Wizard to define a cube that uses those dimensions. If you are designing a complex solution, you generally start by defining the dimensions. For more information, see [Dimensions in Multidimensional Models](../multidimensional-models/dimensions-in-multidimensional-models.md) or [Cubes in Multidimensional Models](../multidimensional-models/cubes-in-multidimensional-models.md).  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Completed projects for all of the lessons in this tutorial are available online. You can jump ahead to any lesson by using the completed project from the previous lesson as a starting point. See [Analysis Services samples](../analysis-services-samples.md) to download the sample projects that go with this tutorial.  
  
This lesson contains the following tasks:  
  
[Defining a Dimension](lesson-2-1-defining-a-dimension.md)  
In this task, you use the Dimension Wizard to define a dimension.  
  
[Defining a Cube](lesson-2-2-defining-a-cube.md)  
In this task, you use the Cube Wizard to define an initial [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] cube.  
  
[Adding Attributes to Dimensions](lesson-2-3-adding-attributes-to-dimensions.md)  
In this task, you add attributes to the dimensions that you created.  
  
[Reviewing Cube and Dimension Properties](lesson-2-4-reviewing-cube-and-dimension-properties.md)  
In this task, you review the structure of the cube that you defined by using the Cube Wizard.  
  
[Deploying an Analysis Services Project](lesson-2-5-deploying-an-analysis-services-project.md)  
In this task, you deploy the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project to your local instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], and learn about certain deployment properties.  
  
[Browsing the Cube](lesson-2-6-browsing-the-cube.md)  
In this task, you browse the cube and dimension data by using Excel or the MDX query designer.
