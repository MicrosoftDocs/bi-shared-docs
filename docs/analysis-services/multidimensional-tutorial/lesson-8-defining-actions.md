# Lesson 8: Defining Actions
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]

In this lesson, you will learn to define actions in your [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project. An action is just a Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) statement that is stored in [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] and which can be incorporated into client applications and started by a user.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> Completed projects for all of the lessons in this tutorial are available online. You can jump ahead to any lesson by using the completed project from the previous lesson as a starting point. See [Analysis Services samples](../analysis-services-samples.md) to download the sample projects that go with this tutorial.  
  
[!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] supports the types of actions that are described in the following table.  
  
| Action | Description |  
| ------ | ----------- |
|CommandLine|Executes a command at the command prompt|  
|Dataset|Returns a dataset to a client application.|  
|Drillthrough|Returns a drillthrough statement as an expression, which the client executes to return a rowset|  
|Html|Executes an HTML script in an Internet browser|  
|Proprietary|Performs an operation by using an interface other than those listed in this table.|  
|Report|Submits a parameterized URL-based request to a report server and returns a report to a client application.|  
|Rowset|Returns a rowset to a client application.|  
|Statement|Runs an OLE DB command.|  
|URL|Displays a dynamic Web page in an Internet browser.|  
  
Actions let users start an application or perform other steps within the context of a selected item. For more information, see [Actions &#40;Analysis Services - Multidimensional Data&#41;](../multidimensional-models/actions-analysis-services-multidimensional-data.md), [Actions in Multidimensional Models](../multidimensional-models/actions-in-multidimensional-models.md)  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> For examples of actions, see the action examples on the Templates tab in the Calculation Tools pane or in the examples in the [!INCLUDE[ssSampleDBCoShort](../includes/sssampledbcoshort-md.md)] DW sample data warehouse. For more information about installing this database, see [Install Sample Data and Projects for the Analysis Services Multidimensional Modeling Tutorial](install-sample-data-and-projects.md).  
  
This lesson includes the following task:  
  
[Defining and Using a Drillthrough Action](lesson-8-1-defining-and-using-a-drillthrough-action.md)  
In this task, you define, use, and then modify a drillthrough action through the fact dimension relationship that you defined earlier in this tutorial.
