# Setting Security for Stored Procedures
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  Security for stored procedures is set with the **PermissionSet** property on a stored procedure for an instance of [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] (server level), an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database, or an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project.
