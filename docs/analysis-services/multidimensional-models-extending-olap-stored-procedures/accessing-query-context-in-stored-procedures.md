# Accessing Query Context in Stored Procedures
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas](../includes/appliesto-sqlas.md)]
  The execution context of a stored procedure is available within the code of the stored procedure as the **Context** object of the ADOMD.NET server object model. This is a read-only context and cannot be modified by the stored procedure. The following properties are available on this object.  
  
|Property|Type|Description|  
|--------------|----------|-----------------|  
|**CurrentCube**|Cube|The cube for the current query context.|  
|**CurrentDatabaseName**|String|The identifier of the current database.|  
|**CurrentConnection**|Connection|A reference to the connection object in the current context.|  
|**Pass**|Integer|The pass number for the current context.|  
  
 The **Context** object exists when the Multidimensional Expressions (MDX) object model is used in a stored procedure. It is not available when the MDX object model is used on a client. The **Context** object is not explicitly passed to or returned by the stored procedure. It is available during the execution of the stored procedure.
