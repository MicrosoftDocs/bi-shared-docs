# TMSL Reference - Tabular Objects

[!INCLUDE[ssas-appliesto-sql2016-later-aas-pbip](../includes/ssas-appliesto-sql2016-later-aas-pbip.md)]

  Applications that create, consume, or administer tabular databases or that connect to a server instance can use the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) for commands and object representations in JSON format.  
  
 This article documents the major objects of the TMSL schema used in scripts generated by SQL Server Management Studio, SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT), and AMO PowerShell.  
  
 Object definitions are in JSON and used in TMSL commands like Create, Alter, and Delete. See [Commands in Tabular Model Scripting Language &#40;TMSL&#41;](tmsl-reference-commands.md) for a list of commands.
