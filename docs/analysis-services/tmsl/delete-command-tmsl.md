# Delete command (TMSL)

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2016-later-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sql2016-later-aas-pbip.md)]

  Deletes a database or an object in the current database. 
It deletes the specified object and all child objects and collections. If the object does not exist, the command raises an error.  
  
## Request  

 The object being deleted is specified by using the object path. For example, deleting a partition requires that you specify the table and database objects that precede it.  
  
```json   
{   
  "delete": {   
    "object": {   
      "database": "AdventureworksDW2016",   
      "table": "Reseller Sales",   
      "partition": "may2011"   
    }   
  }   
}   
```  
  
 You can delete the following objects:

## Usage (endpoints)  

 This command element is used in  a statement of the Execute Method (XMLA) call over an XMLA endpoint, exposed in the following ways:  
  
- As an XMLA window in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
  
- As an input file to the **invoke-ascmd** PowerShell cmdlet  
  
- As an input to an SSIS task or SQL Server Agent job  
  
 You can generate a ready-made script  for this command from SSMS.  For example, you can right-click an existing database > **Script** > **Script Database as** > **DELETE To**.
