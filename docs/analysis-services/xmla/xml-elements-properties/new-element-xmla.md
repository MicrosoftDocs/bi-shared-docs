## Remarks  
 The **New** element contains a UNC path that replaces the value of the **Original** element contained by the parent **Folder** element for all objects restored or synchronized, respectively, during a **Restore** or **Synchronize** command. The value of the **Original** element is compared to the value of the **StorageLocation** element for each cube, measure group, or partition and, if a match is found, the value of this element is used to update the **StorageLocation** of the object during restoration or synchronization.
