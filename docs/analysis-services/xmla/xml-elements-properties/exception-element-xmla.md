## Remarks  
 If an error occurs during the execution of a **Discover** method call or a single XMLA command in an **Execute** method call that prevents the method or command from completing, the **root** element for that method or command contains an **Exception** element and a **Messages** element. The **Exception** element indicates that an error which prevented the method or command from successfully executing occurred, and the **Messages** element contains the list of error or warning messages related to the error.
