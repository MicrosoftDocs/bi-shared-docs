|Child elements|None|  
  
## Remarks  
 The **BeginTransaction** command begins an active transaction on the current session. If an active transaction already exists, the Analysis Services instance increments the reference count of transactions for the current session. If not, the instance will begin a new transaction and set the reference count for the current session to 1. If an active transaction is explicitly specified using the **BeginTransaction** command, all subsequent commands are executed inside the explicitly specified transaction.  
  
 When the current session is ended and the reference count for transactions is higher than zero, all active transactions are rolled back.  
  
 If there are no explicitly specified active transactions on the current session, every command issued on the current session is executed inside an implicitly defined transaction. The implicit transaction is committed if the command succeeds, or rolled back if the command fails.
