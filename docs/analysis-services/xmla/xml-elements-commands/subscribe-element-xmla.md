# Subscribe Element (XMLA)

  Subscribes to a trace and returns a rowset that contains the trace events from a Analysis Services instance.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```xml  
  
<Command>  
   <Subscribe>  
      <Object>...</Object>  
   </Subscribe>  
</Command>  
```

## Element relationships  
  
|Relationship|Element|  
|------------------|-------------|  
|Parent elements|[Command](../xml-elements-properties/command-element-xmla.md)|  
|Child elements|[Object](../xml-elements-properties/object-element-xmla.md)|  
  
## Remarks  
 The **Subscribe** command subscribes to and streams back a rowset from a specified trace on an Analysis Services instance. If an object other than a trace is specified in the **Object** element, an error occurs.  
  
 If the **Object** element is not specified, a session trace is defined and subscribed to on the Analysis Services instance. The session trace returns a fixed set of trace events from the current session.  
  
 The rowset stream returned by this command is terminated if the client application closes the connection to the Analysis Services instance, or if the session on which the **Subscribe** command is executed is terminated.
