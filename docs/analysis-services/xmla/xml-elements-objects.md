# XML Elements - Objects

  The XML for Analysis (XMLA) protocol uses two methods, **Discover** and **Execute**, to offer a standard way for applications to access information on an instance of Analysis Services. Because these methods are invoked by using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) protocol, they accept input and deliver output in XML.  
  
## In this section

 The following topics describe the XMLA objects implemented by Analysis Services.  
  
|Method|Description|
