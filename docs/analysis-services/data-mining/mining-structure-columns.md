# Mining Structure Columns
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2019-earlier](../includes/appliesto-sql2019-earlier.md)]

  You define the columns in a mining structure when you create the mining structure, by choosing columns of external data and then specifying how the data is to be used for modeling. Therefore, mining structure columns are more than copies of data from a data source: they define how the data from the source is to be used by the mining model. You can assign properties that determine how the data is discretized, properties that describe how the data values are distributed  
  
 Mining structure columns are designed to be flexible and extensible, because each algorithm that you use to build a mining model may use different columns from the structure to interpret the data. Rather than have one set of data for each model, you can use a single mining structure and use the columns in it to customize the data for each model.  
  
## Defining Mining Structure Columns  
 The basic data types and content types that define structure columns are derived from the data source that you use to create the structure. You can change these settings within the mining structure, and you can also set modeling flags and set the distribution for continuous columns.  
  
 The definition of a mining structure column must contain the following information:  
  
-   **ID**: The unique name of the column, often the same as the name. This cannot be changed after you create the mining structure, whereas the name can be changed.  
  
-   **Name**: A name or alias for the column.  
  
-   **Content**: An enumeration that describes whether the data is discrete or continuous.  
  
-   **Type**: An enumeration that indicates the general data type.  
  
-   **Distribution**: An enumeration that describes the expected distribution of values. A distribution is included if the column is continuous.  
  
-   **Modeling flags**: An enumeration that indicates how to handle missing values and so forth. Modeling flags can also be defined on the mining model, but the model flags are different than the flags used on structure columns.  
  
-   **Bindings**: Properties that specify the source data.  
  
 Third-party algorithms may also include custom properties that can be defined on the mining structure column.
