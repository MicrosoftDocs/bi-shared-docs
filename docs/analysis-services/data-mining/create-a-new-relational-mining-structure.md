# Create a New Relational Mining Structure
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2019-earlier](../includes/appliesto-sql2019-earlier.md)]

[!INCLUDE[dm-dep-banner](../includes/dm-dep-banner.md)]

  Use the Data Mining Wizard to create a new mining structure, using data from a relational database or other source, and then save the structure and any related models to a [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database.  
  
## To create a relational mining structure  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Mining Structures** folder in an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project, and then click **New Mining Structure**.  
  
     The Data Mining Wizard opens.  
  
2.  On the **Welcome to the Data Mining Wizard** page, click **Next**.  
  
3.  On the **Select the Definition Method** page, select **From existing relational database or data warehouse**, and then click **Next**.  
  
4.  On the **Select the Data Mining Technique** page, select the data mining algorithm that you want to use, and then click **Next**.  
  
     For more information about data mining algorithms, see [Data Mining Algorithms &#40;Analysis Services - Data Mining&#41;](../../analysis-services/data-mining/data-mining-algorithms-analysis-services-data-mining.md).  
  
5.  On the **Select Data Source View** page, under **Available data source views**, click the data source view that you want to use, and then click **Next**.  
  
     For more information about creating a data source view, see [Data Source Views in Multidimensional Models](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/data-source-views-in-multidimensional-models.md).  
  
6.  On the **Specify Table Types** page, under **Input tables**, select a case table and a nested table.  
  
7.  On the **Specify the Training Data** page, under **Mining model structure**, select the key, input, and predictable columns.  
  
     After you select the predictable column, you can click the **Suggest** button to open the **Suggest Related Columns** dialog box. You can accept the suggested columns by clicking **OK** in this dialog box to include the selected columns in the mining structure, or you can change the selections in the **Input** column first, and then click **OK**. To ignore the suggestions, click **Cancel**.  
  
8.  Click **Next**.  
  
9. On the **Specify Columns' Content and Data Type** page, under **Mining model structure**, you can adjust the content type and data type for each column.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You can click **Detect** to automatically detect whether a column contains continuous or discrete data. After you click this button, the column content and data types will be updated in the **Content Type** and **Data Type** columns. For more information about content types and data types, see [Content Types &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../../analysis-services/data-mining/content-types-data-mining.md) and [Data Types &#40;Data Mining&#41;](../../analysis-services/data-mining/data-types-data-mining.md).  
  
10. Click **Next**.  
  
11. On the **Completing the Wizard** page, provide a name for the mining structure and the related initial mining model that will be created, and then click **Finish**.
