[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2019-earlier](../includes/appliesto-sql2019-earlier.md)]

[!INCLUDE[dm-dep-banner](../includes/dm-dep-banner.md)]

  You can change the colors that are used in the data mining viewers to display data series, nodes, or clusters. You do this by setting options in [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)]. After you have changed the settings, the color selections apply to all models that you view by using [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)]; however, you must close [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] and reopen the model in the viewer to see the new colors.  
  
### To change the colors used in the data mining viewers  
  
1.  On the **Tools** menu of [!INCLUDE[ssBIDevStudioFull](../includes/ssbidevstudiofull-md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], select **Options**.  
  
2.  In the **Options** dialog box, expand **Designers**, and then expand **Data Mining Viewers**.  
  
3.  Find the viewer property that you want to change, and click the current color selection.  
  
4.  Select a new color from the dropdown list. Click the **Custom** tab to select a color from the palette of custom colors available on the current computer, or click **System** to select a color from among the colors specified in the Windows color scheme.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  If you use a custom color, the color is represented by a color icon and the RBG values of the color. If you use a System color or Web color, the color is represented by a color icon and the name of the color.
