### [Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL)](./tmsl/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference.md)

A command and object model definition syntax for tabular models at compatibility level 1200 or higher. TMSL communicates through the XMLA protocol, where the XMLA.Execute method accepts both JSON-based and ASSL-based scripts.

### [Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL for XMLA)](./assl/analysis-services-scripting-language-assl-for-xmla.md)

Client applications can communicate with Analysis Services using XML commands and object descriptions. ASSL represents the object definition language portion of this XML dialect.

::: moniker range="asallproducts-allversions || azure-analysis-services-current"

### [PowerShell for Azure Analysis Services](/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-powershell)

PowerShell cmdlets used for resource management tasks like creating or deleting a server resource, suspending or resuming operations, or changing the service level (tier). Other tasks for managing databases like adding or removing role members, processing, or partitioning use cmdlets included in the SqlServer module.
