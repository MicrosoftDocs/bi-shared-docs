# Mark as Date Table

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2019-later-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sql2019-later-aas-pbip.md)]

In Lesson 2: Get data, you imported a dimension table named **DimDate**. While in your model this table is named DimDate, it can also be known as a *Date table*, in that it contains date and time data.  
  
Whenever you use DAX time intelligence functions, like when you create measures later, you must specify properties which include a *Date table* and a unique identifier *Date column* in that table.
  
In this lesson, you mark the **DimDate** table as the *Date table* and the **Date** column (in the Date table) as the *Date column* (unique identifier).  

Before you mark the date table and date column, it's a good time to do a little housekeeping to make your model easier to understand. Notice in the DimDate table a column named **FullDateAlternateKey**. This column contains one row for every day in each calendar year included in the table. You use this column a lot in measure formulas and in reports. But, FullDateAlternateKey isn't really a good identifier for this column. You rename it to **Date**, making it easier to identify and include in formulas. Whenever possible, it's a good idea to rename objects like tables and columns to make them easier to identify in tools and client reporting applications. 
  
Estimated time to complete this lesson: **Three minutes**  
  
## Prerequisites  

This article is part of a tabular modeling tutorial, which should be completed in order. Before performing the tasks in this lesson, you should have completed the previous lesson: [Lesson 2: Get data](../tutorial-tabular-1400/as-lesson-2-get-data.md). 

### To rename the FullDateAlternateKey column

1.  In the model designer, click the **DimDate** table.

2.  Double-click the header for the **FullDateAlternateKey** column, and then rename it to **Date**.

  
### To set Mark as Date Table  
  
1.  Select the **Date** column, and then in the **Properties** window, under **Data Type**, make sure  **Date** is selected.  
  
2.  Click **Extensions** > **Table** > **Date** > **Mark as Date Table**.  
  
3.  In the **Mark as Date Table** dialog box, in the **Date** listbox, select the **Date** column as the unique identifier. It's usually selected by default. Click **OK**.
