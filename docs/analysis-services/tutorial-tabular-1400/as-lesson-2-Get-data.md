# Get data

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sql2019-later-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sql2019-later-aas-pbip.md)]

In this lesson, you use **Get Data** to connect to the AdventureWorksDW sample database, select data, preview and filter, and then import into your model workspace.  
  
Under the hood, Get Data is Power Query, which provides a vast array of tools for connecting to and reshaping data for modeling and analysis. To learn more, see [Power Query Documentation](/power-query/). 

> [!NOTE]
> Tasks and images in this tutorial show connecting to an AdventureWorksDW database on an Azure Synapse Analytics resource. In some cases, an AdventureWorksDW database on SQL Server Data Warehouse may show different objects; however, they are fundamentally the same.
  
Estimated time to complete this lesson: **10 minutes**  
  
## Prerequisites  

This article is part of a tabular modeling tutorial, which should be completed in order. Before performing the tasks in this lesson, you should have completed the previous lesson: [Lesson 1: Create a new tabular model project](../tutorial-tabular-1400/as-lesson-1-create-a-new-tabular-model-project.md).  
  
## Create a connection  
  
#### To create a connection to the AdventureWorksDW database
  
1.  In **Tabular Model Explorer**, right-click **Data Sources** > **Import from Data Source**.  
  
    This launches **Get Data**, which guides you through connecting to a data source. If you don't see Tabular Model Explorer, in **Solution Explorer**, double-click **Model.bim** to open the model in the designer. 
    
    ![Screenshot of the Get Data dialog box with the Azure and Azure SQL Data Warehouse options highligted and selected.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-getdata.png)
  
2.  In Get Data, click **Azure** > **Azure SQL Data Warehouse**, and then click **Connect**.  
  
3.  In the **SQL Server Database** dialog, in **Server**, type or paste the name of the server where you installed the AdventureWorksDW database, and then click **Connect**.

    If you created an Azure SQL Data Warehouse with the AdventureWorksDW sample database, you can copy the server name from the Overview page in the Azure portal.

4.  When prompted to enter credentials, you need to specify the credentials Analysis Services uses to connect to the data source when importing and processing data. Select **Microsoft account**, and then click **Sign in**. Follow the prompts. When you're signed in, click **Connect**.

    ![Screenshot of the SQL Server database dialog box with the Microsoft account option highlighted and selected.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-account.png)
  
    If your datasource is an on-premises or VM SQL Server Data Warehouse, choose **Windows** > **Impersonate Account**, and then enter an account name and password.
  
5.  In Navigator, select the **AdventureWorksDW** database, and then click **OK**. This creates the connection to the database. 
  
6.  In Navigator, select the check box for the following tables: **DimCustomer**, **DimDate**, **DimGeography**, **DimProduct**, **DimProductCategory**, **DimProductSubcategory**, and **FactInternetSales**. After selecting the tables, click **Transform Data**. 

    ![Screenshot of the NAvigator dialog box witht eh Display Options section and the Transform Data option called out.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-select-tables.png)
  
After you click **Transform Data**, Power Query Editor opens. In the next section, you select only the data you want to import.

  
## Filter the table data  

Tables in the AdventureWorksDW sample database have data that isn't necessary to include in your model. When possible, you want to filter out unnecessary data to save in-memory space used by the model. You filter out some of the columns from tables so they're not imported into the workspace database, or the model database after it has been deployed. 
  
#### To filter the table data before importing  
  
1.  In Power Query Editor > **Queries**, select the **DimCustomer** table. A view of the DimCustomer table at the datasource (your AdventureWorksDW sample database) appears. 
  
2.  Multi-select (Ctrl + click) **SpanishEducation**, **FrenchEducation**, **SpanishOccupation**, **FrenchOccupation**, then right-click, and then click **Remove Columns**. 

    ![Screenshot of the Power Query Editor with the SpanishEducation, FrenchEducation, SpanishOccupation, FrenchOccupation columns selected and the Remove Columns option highlighted.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-remove-columns.png)
  
    Since the values for these columns are not relevant to Internet sales analysis, there is no need to import these columns. Eliminating unnecessary columns makes your model smaller and more efficient.  

    > [!TIP]
    > If you make a mistake, you can backup by deleting a step in **APPLIED STEPS**.   
    
    ![Screenshot of the Query Settings dialog box with the Removed Columns option highlighted and called out.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-remove-step.png)

  
4.  Filter the remaining tables by removing the following columns in each table:  
    
    **DimDate**
    
      ||  
      |--------|  
      |**SpanishDayNameOfWeek**|  
      |**FrenchDayNameOfWeek**|  
      |**SpanishMonthName**|  
      |**FrenchMonthName**|  
  
    **DimGeography**
  
      ||  
      |-------------|  
      |**SpanishCountryRegionName**|  
      |**FrenchCountryRegionName**|  
  
    **DimProduct**
  
      ||  
      |-----------|  
      |**SpanishProductName**|  
      |**FrenchProductName**|  
      |**FrenchDescription**|  
      |**ChineseDescription**|  
      |**ArabicDescription**|  
      |**HebrewDescription**|  
      |**ThaiDescription**|  
      |**GermanDescription**|  
      |**JapaneseDescription**|  
      |**TurkishDescription**|  
  
    **DimProductCategory**
  
      ||  
      |--------------------|  
      |**SpanishProductCategoryName**|  
      |**FrenchProductCategoryName**|  
  
    **DimProductSubcategory**
  
      ||  
      |-----------------------|  
      |**SpanishProductSubcategoryName**|  
      |**FrenchProductSubcategoryName**|  
  
    **FactInternetSales**
  
      No columns removed.
  
## <a name="Import"></a>Import the selected tables and column data  

Now that you've previewed and filtered out unnecessary data, you can import the rest of the data you do want. The wizard imports the table data along with any relationships between tables. New tables and columns are created in the model and data that you filtered out isn't imported.  
  
#### To import the selected tables and column data  
  
1.  Review your selections. If everything looks okay, click **Import**. The Data Processing dialog shows the status of data being imported from your datasource into your workspace database.
  
    ![Screenshot of the Data Processing dialog box showing Success.](../tutorial-tabular-1400/media/as-lesson2-success.png) 
  
2.  Click **Close**.  

  
## Save your model project  

It's important to frequently save your model project.  
  
#### To save the model project  
  
-   Click **File** > **Save All**.
