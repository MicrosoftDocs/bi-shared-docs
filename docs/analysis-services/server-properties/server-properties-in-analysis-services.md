# Server properties in Analysis Services

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip.md)]

Administrators can modify many default configuration properties of an Azure Analysis Services (Azure AS) server resource, SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) server instance, or a Power BI workspace assigned to a Premium capacity. Modifying default configuration properties is not supported for Power BI Premium per user.

Properties pages in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) show a subset of those properties most likely to be modified. For Azure AS and Power BI, all applicable properties can be modified by using XMLA script in SSMS. For SQL Server Analysis Services, all applicable properties can be modified in the msmdsrv.ini file.

> [!NOTE]
> In Power BI, a workspace is effectively an Analysis Services server. In context of Analysis Services, the terms workspace, server, and instance are synonymous.

## Permissions

For Azure AS and SSAS, server administrator permissions are required to modify server properties.

For Power BI, workspace admin permissions are required to modify workspace properties.

## Power BI XMLA-based workspace properties

Power BI workspaces support modifying a limited subset of XMLA-based Analysis Services properties in the General, DAX, Filestore, Memory, and OLAP categories by using SSMS. When modified, the change applies only to that workspace.

Some XMLA-based workspace properties have equivalent capacity settings that can be set in the Admin portal, in **Capacity settings**/**Workloads**/**SEMANTIC MODELS**. These settings apply to *all* workspaces assigned to the capacity, however, workspace admins can override settings for a specific workspace by using SSMS.

|Analysis Services property  |Category | Power BI Capacity setting  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|[AdminTimeOut](general-properties.md#admintimeout)    | General |  NA     |
|[ClientCacheRefreshPolicy](general-properties.md#clientcacherefreshpolicy)     | General |   NA    |
|[CommitTimeout](general-properties.md#committimeout)     | General |   NA    |
|[DefaultSegmentRowCount](general-properties.md#defaultsegmentrowcount)    |  General |   NA   |
|[ExternalCommandTimeout](general-properties.md#externalcommandtimeout)    |  General |   NA   |
|[ExternalConnectionTimeout](general-properties.md#externalconnectiontimeout)     |  General |   NA   |
|[ForceCommitTimeout](general-properties.md#forcecommittimeout)    |  General |  NA    |
|[MaxIntermediateRowsetSize](dax-properties.md#properties)      | DAX |[Max Intermediate Row Set Count](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads?tabs=gen2#max-intermediate-row-set-count) |
|[MaxOfflineDatasetSizeGB](filestore-properties.md#maxofflinedatasetsizegb)     |  Filestore | [Max Offline Dataset Size](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads?tabs=gen2#max-offline-dataset-size)       |
|[RowsetSerializationLimit](olap-properties.md#rowsetserializationlimit)        |  OLAP | [Max Result Row Count](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads?tabs=gen2#max-result-row-set-count)      |
|[QueryMemoryLimit](memory-properties.md#querymemorylimit)        | Memory | [Query Memory Limit](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads?tabs=gen2#query-memory-limit)      |
|[ServerTimeout](general-properties.md#servertimeout)     | General  | [Query Timeout](/power-bi/enterprise/service-admin-premium-workloads?tabs=gen2#query-timeout)      |

Capacity admins can enable or disable the ability for workspace admins to modify XMLA-based workspace property settings. By default, this setting is enabled, meaning workspace admins can modify workspace property settings by using SSMS. Capacity admins can disable this setting in the Admin portal, in **Capacity settings** > **Workloads** > **SEMANTIC MODELS** > **Observe XMLA-based settings**. 

When disabled, workspace admins can't modify *any* XMLA-based property setting.

## Configure by using SQL Server Management Studio
  
1. In [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], connect to an SSAS, Azure AS, or Power BI instance.  
  
2. In Object Explorer, right-click the instance, and then click **Properties**. The General page appears, displaying the more commonly used properties.  

3. To show more properties, click the **Show Advanced (All) Properties** checkbox at the bottom of the page.

## Configure by using XMLA script

Those properties that can't be set in the Properties page in SSMS or in the msmdrsrv.ini file (SSAS only) can be set by using the [XMLA Alter Element](../xmla/xml-elements-commands/alter-element-xmla.md) in an XMLA script in SSMS.

## Configure in msmdsrv.ini
  
For SSAS, server properties are in the msmdsrv.ini file. If the property you want to set isn't visible even after you show advanced properties in SSMS, you might need to edit the msmdsrv.ini file directly. For a default installation, msmdsrv.ini can be found in the \Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSAS13.MSSQLSERVER\OLAP\Config folder.
  
1. Check the **DataDir** property in the General properties page in Management Studio to verify the location of the Analysis Services program files, including the msmdsrv.ini file.

     On a server that has multiple instances, checking the program file location ensures you're modifying the correct file.  
  
2. Navigate to the **config** folder of the program files folder location.

3. Create a backup of the file in case you need to revert to the original file.  
  
4. Use a text editor to view or edit the msmdsrv.ini file.  
  
5. Save the file and restart the service.
