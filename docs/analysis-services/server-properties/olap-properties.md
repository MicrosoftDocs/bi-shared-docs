##### AggregationsUseEnabled

##### AllowSEFiltering

 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
##### CalculationCacheRegistryMaxIterations

##### CalculationEvaluationPolicy

##### ConvertDeletedToUnknown

##### CopyLinkedDataCacheAndRegistry

 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
##### DataCacheRegistryMaxIterations

 An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  
  
##### DefaultDrillthroughMaxRows

 A signed 32-bit integer property that specifies the maximum number of rows that will return from a drill-through query.  
  
 The default value for this property is 10000 (rows).  
  
##### DimensionPropertyCacheSize

 A signed 32-bit integer property that specifies the amount of memory (in bytes) used to cache dimension members used in a query.  
  
 The default is 4,000,000 bytes (or 4 MB) per attribute hierarchy, per active query. The default value provides a well-balanced cache size for solutions having typical hierarchies. However, dimensions with a very large number of members (in the millions) or deep hierarchies perform better if you increase this value.  
  
 Implications of increasing cache size:  
  
- Memory utilization costs increase when you allow more memory to be used by the dimension cache. Actual usage depends on query execution. Not all queries will use the allowable maximum.  
  
     Note that the memory used by these caches is considered nonshrinkable and will be included when accounting against the **TotalMemoryLimit**.  
  
- Affects all databases on the server. **DimensionPropertyCachesize** is a server-wide property. Changing this property affects all databases running on the current instance.  
  
Approach for estimating dimension cache requirements:  
  
1. Start by increasing the size by a large number to determine whether there is a benefit to increasing the dimension cache size. For example, you might want to double the default value as an initial step.  
  
2. If a performance improvement is evident, incrementally reduce the value until you reach a balance between performance and memory utilization.

##### RowsetSerializationLimit

 Applies to Power BI, Azure Analysis Services, and SQL Server 2019 and later only. Limits the number of rows returned in a rowset to clients. Default value is -1, meaning no limit is applied. Applies to both DAX and MDX queries. It can be used to protect server resources from extensive data export. Queries submitted to the server that exceed the limit are cancelled and an error is returned. **Warning:** Do not set to 0, which can result in errors for common operations and could prevent further server access by server administrators.
