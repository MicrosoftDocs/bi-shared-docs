# Lock manager properties

Analysis Services includes the following lock manager server properties.  
  
## Properties

##### DeadlockDetectionGranularityMS

An advanced property that you should not change, except under the guidance of [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] support.  

##### DefaultLockTimeoutMS

A signed 32-bit integer property that defines default lock timeout in milliseconds for internal lock requests.  
  
The default value for this property is -1, which indicates there is no timeout for internal lock requests.
