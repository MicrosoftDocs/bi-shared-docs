# Tabular model solution deployment

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip](../includes/appliesto-sqlas-all-aas-pbip.md)]

After authoring a tabular model project, you must deploy it to an Azure Analysis Services server resource, SQL Server Analysis Services server instance, or semantic model in a Power BI Premium workspace in order for users to browse the model by using a reporting client application. This article describes the various methods you can use when deploying tabular model project.  

## Deployment methods  

 There are several methods you can use to deploy a tabular model project. Most of the deployment methods used for Analysis Services multidimensional projects can also be used to deploy tabular model projects.  
  
|Method|Description|Link|  
|------------|-----------------|----------|  
|**Deploy command in Visual Studio**|The Deploy command provides a simple and intuitive method to deploy a tabular model project from the Visual Studio authoring environment.<br /><br /> **Caution:** This method should not be used to deploy to production servers. Using this method can overwrite certain properties in an already deployed, existing model; for example, when using scripts or SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to modify properties.|[Deploy from Visual Studio](../../analysis-services/deployment/deploy-from-visual-studio-tabular.md)|  
|**Tabular Object Model (TOM)**|TOM, an extension of the Analysis Management Object (AMO) client library provides a programmatic interface to the complete command set for [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], including commands that can be used for solution deployment. As an approach for solution deployment, TOM automation is the most flexible, but it also requires a programming effort.  A key advantage to using TOM is that you can use SQL Server Agent with your application to run deployment on a preset schedule.|[Tabular Object Model (TOM)](../tom/introduction-to-the-tabular-object-model-tom-in-analysis-services-amo.md)|  
|**XMLA**|Use [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] to generate an XMLA script of the metadata of an existing [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database, and then run that script on another server to recreate the initial database. XMLA scripts are easily formed in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)] by defining the deployment process, then codifying it and saving it in an XMLA script. Once you have the XMLA script in a saved file, you can easily run the script according to a schedule, or embed the script in an application that connects directly to an instance.<br /><br /> You can also run XMLA Scripts on a preset basis using SQL Server Agent, but you do not have the same flexibility with XMLA Scripts as with TOM. TOM provides a larger breadth of functionality with more administrative commands.|[Deploy model solutions by using XMLA](../../analysis-services/deployment/deploy-model-solutions-using-xmla.md)|  
|**Deployment Wizard**|Use the Deployment Wizard to use the XMLA output files generated by an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] project to deploy the project's metadata to a destination server. With the Deployment Wizard, you can deploy directly from the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] file, as created by the output directory by project build.<br /><br /> The primary advantage of using the [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] Deployment Wizard is convenience. Just as you can save an XMLA script for use later in [!INCLUDE[ssManStudioFull](../includes/ssmanstudiofull-md.md)], you can save Deployment Wizard scripts. The Deployment Wizard can be run both interactively and at the command prompt via the Deployment Utility.|[Deploy model solutions by using the Deployment Wizard](../../analysis-services/deployment/deploy-model-solutions-using-the-deployment-wizard.md)|  
|**Deployment utility**|The Deployment utility lets you start the Analysis Services deployment engine from a command prompt.|[Deploy model solutions with the Deployment Utility](../../analysis-services/deployment/deploy-model-solutions-with-the-deployment-utility.md)|  
|**Synchronize Database Wizard**|For SQL Server Analysis Services, use the Synchronize Database Wizard to synchronize the metadata and data between any two databases. <br /><br /> The Synchronize Wizard can be used to copy both data and metadata from a source server to a destination server. If the destination server does not have a copy of the database that you want to deploy, a new database is copied to the destination server. If the destination server already has a copy of the same database, the database on the destination server is updated to use the metadata and data of the source database.|[Synchronize Analysis Services databases](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/synchronize-analysis-services-databases.md)|  
|**Backup and restore**|For SQL Server Analysis Services, Backup offers the simplest approach to transferring databases. From the **Backup** dialog box, you can set the options configuration, and then you can run the backup from the dialog box itself. Or, you can create a script that can be saved and run as frequently as required.<br /><br /> Backup and restore is not used as frequently as the other deployment methods, and rarely used with tabular models, but is a way to quickly complete a deployment with minimal infrastructure requirements.|[Backup and restore of Analysis Services Databases](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/backup-and-restore-of-analysis-services-databases.md)|
