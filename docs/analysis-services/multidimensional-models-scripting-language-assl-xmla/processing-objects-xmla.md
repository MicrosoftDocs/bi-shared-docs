# Processing Objects (XMLA)
  In [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)], processing is the step or series of steps that turn data into information for business analysis. Processing is different depending on the type of object, but processing is always part of turning data into information.  
  
 To process an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] object, you can use the [Process](../xmla/xml-elements-commands/process-element-xmla.md) command. The **Process** command can process the following objects on an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance:  
  
-   Cubes  
  
-   Databases  
  
-   Dimensions  
  
-   Measure groups  
  
-   Mining models  
  
-   Mining structures  
  
-   Partitions  
  
 To control the processing of objects, the **Process** command has various properties that can be set. The **Process** command has properties that control: how much processing will be done, which objects will be processed, whether to use out-of-line bindings, how to handle errors, and how to manage writeback tables.  
  
## Specifying Processing Options  
 The [Type](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/type-element-xmla.md) property of the **Process** command specifies the processing option to use when processing the object. For more information about processing options, see [Processing Options and Settings &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/processing-options-and-settings-analysis-services.md).  
  
 The following table lists the constants for the **Type** property and the various objects that can be processed using each constant.  
  
|**Type** value|Applicable objects|  
|--------------------|------------------------|  
|*ProcessFull*|Cube, database, dimension, measure group, mining model, mining structure, partition|  
|*ProcessAdd*|Dimension, partition|  
|*ProcessUpdate*|Dimension|  
|*ProcessIndexes*|Dimension, cube, measure group, partition|  
|*ProcessData*|Dimension, cube, measure group, partition|  
|*ProcessDefault*|Cube, database, dimension, measure group, mining model, mining structure, partition|  
|*ProcessClear*|Cube, database, dimension, measure group, mining model, mining structure, partition|  
|*ProcessStructure*|Cube, mining structure|  
|*ProcessClearStructureOnly*|Mining structure|  
|*ProcessScriptCache*|Cube|  
  
 For more information about processing [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] objects, see [Processing a multidimensional model &#40;Analysis Services&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/processing-a-multidimensional-model-analysis-services.md).  
  
## Specifying Objects to be Processed  
 The [Object](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/object-element-xmla.md) property of the **Process** command contains the object identifier of the object to be processed. Only one object can be specified in a **Process** command, but processing an object also processes any child objects. For example, processing a measure group in a cube processes all the partitions for that measure group, while processing a database processes all the objects, including cubes, dimensions, and mining structures, that are contained by the database.  
  
 If you set the **ProcessAffectedObjects** attribute of the **Process** command to true, any related object affected by processing the specified object is also processed. For example, if a dimension is incrementally updated by using the *ProcessUpdate* processing option in the **Process** command, any partition whose aggregations are invalidated because of members being added or deleted is also processed by [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] if **ProcessAffectedObjects** is set to true. In this case, a single **Process** command can process multiple objects on an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance, but [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] determines which objects besides the single object specified in the **Process** command must also be processed.  
  
 However, you can process multiple objects, such as dimensions, at the same time by using multiple **Process** commands within a **Batch** command. Batch operations provide a finer level of control for serial or parallel processing of objects on an [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] instance than using the **ProcessAffectedObjects** attribute, and let you to tune your processing approach for larger [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] databases. For more information about performing batch operations, see [Performing Batch Operations &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-scripting-language-assl-xmla/performing-batch-operations-xmla.md).  
  
## Specifying Out-of-Line Bindings  
 If the **Process** command is not contained by a **Batch** command, you can optionally specify out-of-line bindings in the [Bindings](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/bindings-element-xmla.md), [DataSource](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/datasource-element-xmla.md), and [DataSourceView](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/datasourceview-element-xmla.md) properties of the **Process** command for the objects to be processed. Out-of-line bindings are references to data sources, data source views, and other objects in which the binding exists only during the execution of the **Process** command, and which override any existing bindings associated with the objects being processed. If out-of-line bindings are not specified, the bindings currently associated with the objects to be processed are used.  
  
 Out-of-line bindings are used in the following circumstances:  
  
-   Incrementally processing a partition, in which an alternative fact table or a filter on the existing fact table must be specified to make sure that rows are not counted twice.  
  
-   Using a data flow task in [!INCLUDE[msCoName](../includes/msconame-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssNoVersion](../includes/ssnoversion-md.md)] [!INCLUDE[ssISnoversion](../includes/ssisnoversion-md.md)] to provide data while processing a dimension, mining model, or partition.  
  
 Out-of-line bindings are described as part of the Analysis Services Scripting Language (ASSL). For more information about out-of-line bindings in ASSL, see [Data Sources and Bindings &#40;SSAS Multidimensional&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models/data-sources-and-bindings-ssas-multidimensional.md).  
  
### Incrementally Updating Partitions  
 Incrementally updating an already processed partition typically requires an out-of-line binding because the binding specified for the partition references fact table data already aggregated within the partition. When incrementally updating an already processed partition by using the **Process** command, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] performs the following actions:  
  
-   Creates a temporary partition with a structure identical to that of the partition to be incrementally updated.  
  
-   Processes the temporary partition, using the out-of-line binding specified in the **Process** command.  
  
-   Merges the temporary partition with the existing selected partition.  
  
 For more information about merging partitions using XML for Analysis (XMLA), see [Merging Partitions &#40;XMLA&#41;](../../analysis-services/multidimensional-models-scripting-language-assl-xmla/merging-partitions-xmla.md).  
  
## Handling Processing Errors  
 The [ErrorConfiguration](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/errorconfiguration-element-xmla.md) property of the **Process** command lets you specify how to handle errors encountered while processing an object. For example, while processing a dimension, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] encounters a duplicate value in the key column of the key attribute. Because attribute keys must be unique, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] discards the duplicate records. Based on the [KeyDuplicate](../assl/properties/keyduplicate-element-assl.md) property of **ErrorConfiguration**, [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] could:  
  
-   Ignore the error and continue processing the dimension.  
  
-   Return a message that states [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] encountered a duplicate key and continue processing.  
  
 There are many similar conditions for which **ErrorConfiguration** provides options during a **Process** command.  
  
## Managing Writeback Tables  
 If the **Process** command encounters a write-enabled partition, or a cube or measure group for such a partition, that is not already fully processed, a writeback table may not already exist for that partition. The [WritebackTableCreation](../xmla/xml-elements-properties/writebacktablecreation-element-xmla.md) property of the **Process** command determines whether [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] should create a writeback table.  
  
## Examples  
  
### Description  
 The following example fully processes the [!INCLUDE[ssAWDWsp](../includes/ssawdwsp-md.md)] sample [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database.  
  
### Code  
  
```  
<Process xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/analysisservices/2003/engine">  
  <Object>  
    <DatabaseID>Adventure Works DW Multidimensional 2012</DatabaseID>  
  </Object>  
  <Type>ProcessFull</Type>  
  <WriteBackTableCreation>UseExisting</WriteBackTableCreation>  
</Process>  
```  
  
### Description  
 The following example incrementally processes the **Internet_Sales_2004** partition in the **Internet Sales** measure group of the **Adventure Works DW** cube in the [!INCLUDE[ssAWDWsp](../includes/ssawdwsp-md.md)] sample [!INCLUDE[ssASnoversion](../includes/ssasnoversion-md.md)] database. The **Process** command is adding aggregations for order dates later than December 31, 2006 to the partition by using an out-of-line query binding in the **Bindings** property of the **Process** command to retrieve the fact table rows from which to generate aggregations to add to the partition.
